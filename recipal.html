            <p>Recipal is a personalizable recipe mobile app. To get started, you choose your dietary restrictions (“lactose free” for example) and set your nutritional preferences (”less than 10 grams of sodium”). Then, you choose a recipe. Recipal warns users if a recipe or ingredient violates their restrictions or preferences. The app recommends alternative ingredients and allows users to make ingredient swaps while cooking.</p>
            <p>Recipal is the result of my first undergraduate design course, CS 147 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction taught by James Landay. I had always been fascinated with interactive experiences, especially those used for storytelling or education. I wanted to explore if UI/UX was for me. I had some design cycle experience from high school but building Recipal was like riding a roller coaster with endless loop de loops. That said, I learned a lot about iterative design, mobile app development, and team collaboration. </p>
            <p>I was ready to create designs so I did not expect to be conducting interviews in the first few weeks. Of course, I now realize needfinding is important to finding a problem. Good products solve real problems! My team knew we were interested in the food space so we talked to individuals from home chefs to street food vendors. We heard several stories about folks struggling with special dietary needs or ingredient substitutions. Thus, we decided to tackle the question, “How might we help people manage uncertainty safely in the kitchen?” </p>
            <p>We had three iterations of what eventually became Recipal. We started with a paper low-fidelity prototype. From there, we moved to a Figma medium-fidelity prototype and finished with our React Native high-fidelity prototype. We conducted numerous user tests and gathered feedback at e each stage. Given that our app allows personalization, we worked really hard at each iteration to ensure a minimalist and aesthetic design that allows users efficient and flexible control.</p>
            <p>Because I had no mobile development experience, I took CS 47 Cross-Platform Mobile Development and learned React Native to build our final prototype. I worked on both the front-end and the back-end, including the personalization interface, the user history functionality, and more. </p>
            <p>Throughout this project, in addition to design and development, I improved a lot at team collaboration. I designed and built Recipal with 3 other amazing people. Being college students with busy lives, we initially struggled to effectively work together on the project. Early on, we decided to work out our norms, capacities, and interests. From there, we emphasized balance of responsibilities, regular communication, and internal deadlines. Because of initial difficult conversations, we established a strong, healthy, and sustainable collaborative environment.</p>
