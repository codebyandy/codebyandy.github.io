                <p>The transition from carbon-emitting to clean energy sources is essential to deterring the current rate of climate change. Solar power energy is one such alternative. However, in order for analysts and policymakers to develop effective solar panel implementation strategies, they require a comprehensive database of existing solar panel locations. To solve this problem, we created a model that detects and calculates solar panel area from satellite imagery.</p>
                <div class="article-img"><img style="width: 100%" src="img/dataset.PNG"></div>
                <p>There is plenty of existing work on this problem. However, for our project, unlike Yu et al. 2018, we used supervised training for image segmentation. We developed a two-step model comprised of 2 CNNs. The model first classified the images for solar panel presence or absence. If there are solar panels present, the model then performs segmentation on solar panel to calculate the area. Both CNNs used a ResNet-34 backbone and were pretrained on ImageNet. We used a 21,520-image dataset for classification and a 3,716-image dataset for segmentation.</p>

                <p>For this project, I primarily focused on the image classification task. I acquired and wrangled coordinate data points for the labeled dataset and collected the satellite images using Google Static Map API. I soon realized that clean, labeled data can sometimes be hard to come by. I also experimented with numerous hyperparameters to increase the accuracy for the classification task.</p>

                <p>This was my first machine learning project and was created for CS 230 Deep Learning, a course co-taught by Andrew Ng and Kian Katanforoosh. I learned about neural networks, including CNNs and RNNs, and how to effectively complete deep learning projects. I gained practical experience with data collection, as well as model training and hyperparameter tuning using TensorFlow and Keras.</p>
